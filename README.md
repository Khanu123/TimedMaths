# TimedMaths
Defining Constants and Operators:

OPERATORS: This list contains the arithmetic operators "+" (addition), "-" (subtraction), and "*" (multiplication).
MIN_OPERAND and MAX_OPERAND: These constants define the minimum and maximum values for the operands in the problems.
TOTAL_PROBLEMS: This constant defines the total number of problems in the quiz.
generate_problem() Function:
This function generates a random arithmetic problem:

Two random operands (left and right) are generated within the specified range.
A random operator is chosen from the OPERATORS list.
An expression string (expr) is constructed using these operands and the operator.
The actual answer to the problem is evaluated using the eval() function.
Initializing Variables:

wrong: This variable will track the number of incorrect answers.
The user is prompted to press Enter to start the quiz.
A separator line is printed for visual clarity.
Starting Timer:
The current time is recorded as the starting time of the quiz.

Quiz Loop:
The code runs a loop for TOTAL_PROBLEMS times:

A random problem is generated using the generate_problem() function.
The user is prompted to solve the problem within the given time.
The user's input is compared to the correct answer.
If the user's guess is incorrect, they are asked to try again, and wrong is incremented.
Ending Timer:
The current time is recorded as the ending time of the quiz.

Displaying Results:

A separator line is printed.
The player is informed about their performance, including the total time taken to complete the quiz.
The number of incorrect answers (wrong) is also displayed.
In summary, this code provides a time-constrained math quiz. Users have to answer a series of arithmetic problems quickly, and their incorrect answers are tracked. This type of game can help users improve their mental math skills and increase their familiarity with basic arithmetic operations. It also introduces concepts like random number generation, timed tasks, and user input processing.
